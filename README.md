# Omilia

Hello there! I'm glad you're here.

**Omilia is a blog developed with AngularJS and Rails.**

## Why Omilia?

I've been eager to try AngularJS for a long time. So I recently started Omilia as an introduction to this front-end framework.

Having developed with Rails for a few years now, I chose it for the back-end. I love Ruby, and I'm fond of Rails *convention over configuration* approach.

I'll use Omilia as a sandbox to experiment with the AngularJS features I read about on various blogs.

You can also use it as an example if you're interested in starting an AngularJS + Rails project. There are already many excellent ones out there, but it's always nice to have multiple sources!

## No, I meant the name. Why?

It's the greek word for *speech* (I'm totally trusting the famous translator on this one). I know. It's not **exactly** the main purpose of a blog but still... it's not so far-fetched and I think it sounds great. :)

## Project status

The project just started.

The current codebase allows you to:
- list all the posts
- view each one of them individually when you click on their title

**Enjoy!**
